# Drumpfer / Chrumper

## Changes or hides webpage text with the name Donald Trump

This bookmarklet attempts to redact any text on a webpage that contains the correct name of Donald Drumpf. To use this bookmarklet, all you need to do is drag the link below, and drop it into your browser's bookmark bar. Refer to the gif at the right.

In the future I would like it to grab a list of all bullshit 'trending' news, and delete/change references to it from your browser's DOM forever.
